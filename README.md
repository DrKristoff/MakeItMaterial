# MakeItMaterial

This is Project 5 for the Udacity Android Nanodegree. From the project description: "In this project, you will update the look and feel of an app to meet Material Design specifications."

We were given some code for an RSS feed app.  We also were given some example feedback from users of the app.  We were to then apply the principles of Material Design to improve the app.
